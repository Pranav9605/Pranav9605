[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/Source-Code-333333?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/Pranav9605/RihlaAi_Travel_Planner)

**Overview:**  
RihlaAi is an AI-driven travel planning system that generates personalized itineraries and forecasts travel costs. It integrates robust data extraction, predictive modeling, and advanced NLP techniques to deliver dynamic travel recommendations enriched with visuals and real-time data.

**Key Features:**

- **LLM Fine-Tuning:**  
  Fine-tuned large language models using MLX (with Mistral on macOS) and Unsloth (with small-parameter LLaMA on Colab) via QLoRA to generate customized itineraries.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Developed forecasting models using Random Forest and XGBoost to accurately predict hotel prices and optimize travel budgets.

- **Enhanced Recommendations with RAG:**  
  Integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using both open-source and OpenAI embeddings for context-aware and dynamic itinerary suggestions.

- **NLP & Data Extraction:**  
  Utilized Selenium and BeautifulSoup for web scraping and spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract key travel terms and images, enriching the itinerary output.

- **Weather Forecasting:**  
  Incorporated Facebook Prophet to provide real-time weather predictions, ensuring itineraries are both practical and adaptable.

- **Production Deployment:**  
  Deployed the solution on AWS EC2 (Linux) for a scalable, production-ready environment.
