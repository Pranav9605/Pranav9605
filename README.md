## LeetCode Profile

I also challenge myself with coding problems on LeetCode to sharpen my problem-solving skills.  
- **Problems Solved:** *XX+* <!-- Update with your count -->
- **Ranking:** *Top Y%* <!-- Update with your ranking or leave as a placeholder -->

Check out my LeetCode profile: [LeetCode Profile](https://leetcode.com/yourusername)  
*(Replace the URL with your actual LeetCode profile link.)*

<!-- Optionally, you can use a dynamic LeetCode card if you set it up. For example: -->
